Set your movie rankings here! Check the file small_movie_list.csv located in the data folder
for the id of each movie in the dataset. For example, Toy Story 3 (2010) has ID 2700, so to rate it "5", you can set
my_ratings[2700] = 5

Ratings are on a scale of 1-5. If you list a movie with a score of 0 it is considered as unseen by the user.
Note: Movies put in this list will not be recommended to you at the end of training as long as they are given a score greater than 0
